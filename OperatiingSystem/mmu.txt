MMU (Memory Management Unit) - Simple Brief
The MMU (Memory Management Unit) is a hardware component in the CPU that:
✅ Translates virtual addresses to physical addresses using the page table.
✅ Manages memory protection (prevents illegal access).
✅ Handles paging & segmentation for efficient memory usage.
✅ Optimizes caching & TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) to speed up address translation.
