STL Components
-------------------------
1️. Containers → Store data (vector, list, map, etc.)
2️. Iterators → Navigate through elements (begin(), end())
3️. Algorithms → Perform operations (sort, find, search, etc.)


1. Containers (Data Structures) 📦
Containers hold collections of objects. Examples:

Sequence Containers: vector, list, deque
Associative Containers: set, map, multimap
Unordered Containers: unordered_set, unordered_map



2. Iterators (Pointers to Elements) 🔄
Iterators help traverse elements in containers.

begin() → First element
end() → Past the last element
++it → Move to the next element



3. Algorithms (Operations on Data) ⚡
Algorithms perform operations like sorting, searching, and modifying elements.

sort() → Sort elements
find() → Search for an element
reverse() → Reverse order
count() → Count occurrences
