Factory Design Pattern:
The Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.

In Simple Terms:
Imagine you want to create different types of vehicles like cars, bikes, and buses. Instead of directly creating each type of vehicle yourself, you ask a Factory to create them for you.

The Factory knows how to create the objects, but the client (you) don’t need to know the details of how they are created.
This allows you to encapsulate the object creation logic and make the code easier to maintain and extend.
Why Use Factory Pattern?
It decouples the object creation logic from the client code. The client does not need to know the specific class of the object being created.
It helps in creating objects based on certain conditions without changing the client code.
Example in Real Life:
If you're ordering a coffee, you don’t need to know how to brew it. You just tell the coffee shop what kind of coffee you want (e.g., cappuccino, espresso), and the shop (Factory) makes it for you.
How It Differs from Others:
Abstract Factory: Creates families of related objects (e.g., creating a family of products like office furniture: chairs, desks).
Builder: Focuses on constructing complex objects with many parts step by step (e.g., building a complex computer).
Prototype: Clones an existing object instead of creating a new one.
Singleton: Ensures only one instance of a class exists.



Factory Pattern vs Simple Object Creation:
Normally, you would create objects directly like this:
Car car;

But in the Factory Pattern, the car object is created by a factory:
VehicleFactory factory;
Car* car = factory.createVehicle("car");


Now, let’s see a simple code example in C++.

Factory Design Pattern in C++
Step 1: Define a Product (Abstract Class)
First, create an abstract class representing the product.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Vehicle {
public:
    virtual void drive() = 0;  // Pure virtual function to be overridden by derived classes
    virtual ~Vehicle() {}
};
Step 2: Create Concrete Products (Classes that implement the abstract class)
Now create concrete classes (like Car, Bike) that implement the Vehicle interface.

class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    void drive() override {
        std::cout << "Driving a Car!" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Bike : public Vehicle {
public:
    void drive() override {
        std::cout << "Riding a Bike!" << std::endl;
    }
};
Step 3: Create the Factory Class
The factory will create different types of vehicles (Car, Bike) based on input.

class VehicleFactory {
public:
    Vehicle* createVehicle(const std::string& type) {
        if (type == "car") {
            return new Car();
        } else if (type == "bike") {
            return new Bike();
        } else {
            return nullptr;
        }
    }
};
Step 4: Use the Factory
Finally, use the factory to create and use objects without knowing their specific types.

int main() {
    VehicleFactory factory;
    Vehicle* myVehicle = factory.createVehicle("car");
    
    if (myVehicle) {
        myVehicle->drive();
        delete myVehicle;  // Remember to delete the created object to avoid memory leaks
    }

    myVehicle = factory.createVehicle("bike");
    if (myVehicle) {
        myVehicle->drive();
        delete myVehicle;
    }

    return 0;
}
Explanation of Code:
We have an abstract Vehicle class with a pure virtual function drive.
We create two concrete classes, Car and Bike, that implement the drive function.
The VehicleFactory class has a method createVehicle which returns a pointer to the appropriate Vehicle object based on the provided type (car or bike).
The main function demonstrates how the VehicleFactory is used to create vehicles.
Why Use Factory Pattern Here?
If you want to add more vehicle types (e.g., Truck, Bus), you don’t have to modify the client code (the main function). You just add a new class (Truck, Bus) and update the factory method to support them.
It separates object creation from usage. The client doesn't need to know how the objects are created, only that it can request them from the factory.
Common Questions Asked about Factory Pattern:
What is the purpose of Factory Design Pattern?

To encapsulate the object creation process and decouple it from the client. It provides an interface for creating objects in a super class but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
When should we use the Factory Pattern?

Use it when you don’t know ahead of time what class objects you will need to create.
When the creation process is complex or involves a series of steps.
When you want to avoid tight coupling between client classes and concrete classes.
How does it differ from Abstract Factory Pattern?

Factory Pattern: Creates one product type based on a condition.
Abstract Factory Pattern: Creates families of related products.
Can the Factory Pattern be used for creating complex objects?

Yes! You can extend the factory pattern to create complex objects by using builders or combining it with other patterns like the Abstract Factory Pattern.

You said:
ok you mean we donot need to specify class of object we want to create
Lets say i want to create bmw
then i donot need to specify that its exact class is " Car"

Exactly! In the Factory Design Pattern, the idea is that you don’t have to specify the exact class when creating an object. You just ask for a type of object you want, and the Factory will figure out which exact class to instantiate and return.

Example with BMW:
Let’s say you want to create a BMW. You don’t need to know that it’s a specific class like BMWCar or BMWTruck. You just ask for a vehicle (which could be a Car, Truck, or something else). The Factory will create the right object based on your request.

Example:
Let’s extend the previous example to make it more specific to the BMW concept.

cpp
Copy
Edit
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Vehicle {
public:
    virtual void drive() = 0;  // Abstract method to be implemented by all vehicles
    virtual ~Vehicle() {}
};

class BMWCar : public Vehicle {
public:
    void drive() override {
        std::cout << "Driving a BMW Car!" << std::endl;
    }
};

class BMWTruck : public Vehicle {
public:
    void drive() override {
        std::cout << "Driving a BMW Truck!" << std::endl;
    }
};

class VehicleFactory {
public:
    Vehicle* createVehicle(const std::string& type) {
        if (type == "BMW Car") {
            return new BMWCar();
        } else if (type == "BMW Truck") {
            return new BMWTruck();
        } else {
            return nullptr;  // In case of an invalid type
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    VehicleFactory factory;
    
    // Create a BMW Car without specifying its exact class (BMWCar)
    Vehicle* myVehicle = factory.createVehicle("BMW Car");
    
    if (myVehicle) {
        myVehicle->drive();  // Output: Driving a BMW Car!
        delete myVehicle;    // Don't forget to delete the object
    }
    
    // Create a BMW Truck without specifying its exact class (BMWTruck)
    myVehicle = factory.createVehicle("BMW Truck");
    
    if (myVehicle) {
        myVehicle->drive();  // Output: Driving a BMW Truck!
        delete myVehicle;
    }

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
In this example, the client (the main function) just specifies the type of vehicle it needs: "BMW Car" or "BMW Truck".
The factory (VehicleFactory) is responsible for creating the correct object, whether it's a BMWCar or a BMWTruck.
The client doesn’t need to know the exact class of the object. It only interacts with the abstract Vehicle class and calls its drive method. The factory handles the details of which specific class (BMWCar, BMWTruck) to instantiate.
Why is this Beneficial?
Decouples the client code: The client does not need to know about the exact implementation or class names like BMWCar or BMWTruck. It simply interacts with a high-level abstraction (Vehicle).
Easier to extend: If you need to add a new type of vehicle, say a BMWMotorcycle, you can do so without modifying the client code. You just extend the factory to handle the new type, and the client doesn’t need any changes.
So, in summary, you ask for the type of object you want (e.g., a BMW vehicle), and the factory returns the right class without you needing to specify it directly.
