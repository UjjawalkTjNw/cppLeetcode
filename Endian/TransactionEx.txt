Begin Transaction:
START TRANSACTION;

Check Product Availability (Read Operation):
SELECT stock_quantity FROM products WHERE product_id = '123';

Update Inventory (Write Operation):
UPDATE products SET stock_quantity = stock_quantity - 1 WHERE product_id = '123';

Record the Purchase (Write Operation):
INSERT INTO orders (order_id, product_id, quantity) VALUES ('456', '123', 1);

Commit the Transaction:
COMMIT;

If all these steps are executed successfully, the transaction is committed, and the customer’s purchase is recorded.
 However, if any step fails (e.g., if there’s an issue updating the inventory), the transaction is rolled back to ensure no partial updates are made:
ROLLBACK;
